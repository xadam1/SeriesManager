# SeriesManager

**Point of this little project, _was mainly to be able to watch series or movies with subtitles on your TV._**

I found out that almost every TV out there knows how to add subtitles _(.srt file)_ to a movie _(.mkv, .avi, .mp4, ...etc)_ simply if you create
new folder name it same as the movie file, put the movie file inside alongside with the subtitles, **and rename everything the same**.

I thought, that it's cool, but quite boring to do, if you want to manage series with 7 seasons and 10 episodes in each season..

### How does it work
App itself is very simple and looks like this

As you can see, you can select **Series folder** (where the movies are located), **Episode Name List** and **Subtitles** _(.zip)_.
_If you wish to just "manage" the series, without subtitles or additional episode names, you can ommit Episode Name List and Subtitles_.

###### Episode Name List
Episode name list can be easily obtained from google, simply by googling name of the series and season.
