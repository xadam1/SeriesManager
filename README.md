# SeriesManager

Point of this little project, was mainly to be able to watch series with subtitles on your TV.

I found out that almost every TV out there knows how to add subtitles (.srt file) to a movie (.mkv, .avi, .mp4, ...etc) simply if you create
new folder name it same as the movie file, put the movie file inside alongside with the subtitles, that have to be renamed same.

I thought, that it's cool, but quite boring to do, if you want to rename series with 7 seasons and 10 episodes in each season..
