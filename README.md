# SeriesManager

**Point of this little project, _was mainly to be able to watch series or movies with subtitles on your TV._**

I found out that almost every TV out there knows how to add subtitles _(.srt file)_ to a movie _(.mkv, .avi, .mp4, ...etc)_ simply if you create
new folder name it same as the movie file, put the movie file inside alongside with the subtitles, **and rename everything the same**.

I thought, that it's cool, but quite boring to do, if you want to manage series with 7 seasons and 10 episodes in each season..

### How does it work
